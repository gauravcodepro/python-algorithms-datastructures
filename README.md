# python-algorithms-datastructures
This repository contains the codes which i have posted and continuing posting on linkedln and contains the solutions for the leetcode, interview query and the codewars questions. I continue to update this in my spare time as a method of defining a new way of solving the problems in a less cumbersome approach aka pythonic way. I will add also the same solutions in Java also, so this will be update continously.  These are totally different approaches i have applied and not the same ones to solve them.
