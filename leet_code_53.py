Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the index
if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.
You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.
# combining magic method with the list iterator for
# checking the variable
# checking the index of the variable
nums.__contains__(target)
[i for i in range(len(nums)) if nums[i] == target]
